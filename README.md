## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.6 or later
- pip (Python package installer)
- Django (compatible version with Django REST Framework)
- Django REST Framework

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rest-framework-tutorial.git
   cd rest-framework-tutorial

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Use `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
```

3. Install the required packages:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Getting Started
1. Set up your Django project:

```
django-admin startproject myproject
cd myproject
```

2. Create a new Django app:

```
python manage.py startapp myapp
```

3. Add your app to the INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py:

```
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'rest_framework',
    'myapp',
]
```

4. Run the initial migrations:

```
python manage.py migrate
```

5. Start the development server:
```
python manage.py runserver
```

## Key Concepts
**Serializers:** Transform complex data types into JSON-compatible formats.

**Views:** Manage request/response logic for your API endpoints.

**URLs:** Define endpoint structures for API interactions.

**Authentication & Permissions:** Secure your API using various authentication methods.

## Example API

This tutorial includes an example API to manage a collection of items. You'll learn to:

Perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
Implement pagination and filtering.
Set up authentication and permissions.

## Testing the API

You can test the API using tools like Postman or curl. Here's an example command to create a new item:

```
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/items/ -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "Sample Item", "description": "This is a sample item."}'
```
